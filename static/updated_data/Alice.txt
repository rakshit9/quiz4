127: happen late that alic had begun to think that veri few thing
128: inde were realli imposs
129: 
130: there seem to be no use in wait by the littl door so she went
131: back to the tabl half hope she might find anoth key on it or at
132: ani rate a book of rule for shut peopl up like telescop thi
133: time she found a littl bottl on it which certainli wa not here
134: befor said alic and round the neck of the bottl wa a paper
135: label with the word drink me beauti print on it in larg
136: letter

143: not rememb the simpl rule their friend had taught them
144: such as that a poker will burn you if you hold it too long
145: and that if you cut your finger deepli with a knife it usual
146: bleed and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a
147: bottl mark poison it is almost certain to disagre with you
148: sooner or later

163: telescop
164: 
165: and so it wa inde she wa now onli ten inch high and her face
166: brighten up at the thought that she wa now the right size for go
167: through the littl door into that love garden first howev she
168: wait for a few minut to see if she wa go to shrink ani further
169: she felt a littl nervou about thi for it might end you know
170: said alic to herself in my go out altogeth like a candl i
171: wonder what i should be like then and she tri to fanci what the
172: flame of a candl is like after the candl is blown out for she could

178: went back to the tabl for it she found she could not possibl reach
179: it she could see it quit plainli through the glass and she tri her
180: best to climb up one of the leg of the tabl but it wa too slipperi
181: and when she had tire herself out with tri the poor littl thing

185: rather sharpli i advis you to leav off thi minut she gener
186: gave herself veri good advic though she veri seldom follow it
187: and sometim she scold herself so sever as to bring tear into

844: it sound an excel plan no doubt and veri neatli and simpli
845: arrang the onli difficulti wa that she had not the smallest idea
846: how to set about it and while she wa peer about anxious among
847: the tree a littl sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
848: great hurri
849: 
850: an enorm puppi wa look down at her with larg round eye and
851: feebli stretch out one paw tri to touch her poor littl
852: thing said alic in a coax tone and she tri hard to whistl to
853: it but she wa terribl frighten all the time at the thought that it
854: might be hungri in which case it would be veri like to eat her up in
855: spite of all her coax
856: 
857: hardli know what she did she pick up a littl bit of stick and
858: held it out to the puppi whereupon the puppi jump into the air off
859: all it feet at onc with a yelp of delight and rush at the stick
860: and made believ to worri it then alic dodg behind a great thistl
861: to keep herself from be run over and the moment she appear on the
862: other side the puppi made anoth rush at the stick and tumbl head
863: over heel in it hurri to get hold of it then alic think it wa
864: veri like have a game of play with a and expect everi
